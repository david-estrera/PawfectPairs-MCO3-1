Install MongoDB and npm on your computer.

In this directory, run "node index.js" in the command line.

If you see an "Error starting MongoDB server: Command failed: mongod" in the command line, that will be fine. That just might mean the database was already running when you ran index.js.

open localhost:3000 in your browser and register :)
